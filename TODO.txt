* Get permissions! Likely will want to offer "uninstall" option to
  those who refuse.

* Add DB for registering, but also for tracking stats. Track number of
  bytes sent and received on which app's behalf. Maybe the UI shows
  these stats, at least in DEBUG build. Might be enough to store
  everything in Serializable objects and write them to preferences as
  Strings.

* Figure out what user sees when launching the app, besides a "nothing
  to see here" message. Maybe list of apps that are using it at least,
  with basic stats.
