Let's try tabs. ABOUT, PERMISSIONS, TEST, and STATS?

PERMISSIONS requests permission. Will likely launch into that on first
install, and be able to post a notification that launches to that when
unable to send the first time.

ABOUT is the explanation of why the app exists.

TEST lets you send an MSB message to yourself to verify it all
works. May require a new permission to look up phone number. I *don't*
want to allow send to arbitrary numbers.

Stats show what apps are using and how many messages and bytes have
been sent/received on their behalf.

* Get permissions! Likely will want to offer "uninstall" option to
  those who refuse.

* Add DB for registering, but also for tracking stats. Track number of
  bytes sent and received on which app's behalf. Maybe the UI shows
  these stats, at least in DEBUG build. Might be enough to store
  everything in Serializable objects and write them to preferences as
  Strings.

* Figure out what user sees when launching the app, besides a "nothing
  to see here" message. Maybe list of apps that are using it at least,
  with basic stats.
