* Add "register" API, and send hashcode of appID at beginning of every message.

* On receiver, use the hashcode to look up appID among registered apps
  and broadcast to that

* Get permissions! Likely will want to offer "uninstall" option to those who refuse.

* Add DB for registering, but also for tracking stats. Track number of
  bytes sent and received on which app's behalf. Maybe the UI shows
  these stats, at least in DEBUG build.

* Figure out what user sees when launching the app, besides a "nothing
  to see here" message. Maybe list of apps that are using it at least,
  with basic stats.
