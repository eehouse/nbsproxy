    <string name="explaination">NBSProxy exists only to forward small
    binary messages via Narrow Band Sockets (called \"data sms\" in
    the Android world) on behalf of other applications you\'ve
    installed.\n\nBecause NBS is a low-level feature of the GSM cell
    phone infrastructure, they only work on GSM networks (i.e. pretty
    much every network in the world except the US carriers Verizon and
    Sprint.)</string>

    <string name="permissions1">To function, NBSProxy requires
    permission to send and receive SMS messages. That\'s because in
    the Android world NBS messages are considered a type of SMS,
    though in fact they\'re completely orthogonal to the user-visible
    text messages you probably exchange with friends and
    family.</string>
    <string name="permissions2">When you enable the permission below
    you\'ll see an Android system dialog prompting you to
    confirm. Disabling the permission requires no
    confirmation.</string>

    <string name="perms_checkbox_label">Grant SMS permission</string>

    <string name="delete_expl">If you\'re not on a GSM phone or if
    you\'re not comfortable granting the permissions NBSProxy needs,
    you might as well uninstall. No hard feelings :-)</string>
